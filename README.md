# pavpop

An R package for fitting phase and amplitude varying population pattern (PAVPOP) models on curve data. 


### Version 0.7 release note
Parallel computations and clustering are temporarily back, and single point samples are now are supported.

### Version 0.6 release note
The package now supports a variety of warping functions (shifts, linear warps, piecewise linear, smooth) and specification of models with fixed warping effects. Parallel computations and clustering are temporarily suspended, but expected to reemerge in the new structure very soon!
